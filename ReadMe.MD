__________________________________________________

In Example.html and Example.css, this repo contains some examples of how positioning properties(sticky, fixed, relative, absolute) might be used. 

For this assignment you will be manipulating - StartingCSS.css (possibly StartingHTML.html) which has starter code. 

Requirements:

1. Modify the Navbar so that it "Sticks" to the top of the webpage (doesn't have to be indefinitely but should be for atleast a short while) when the page scrolls down. 

2. Position somewhere part of the way down the page a "Fixed" notice that says something like "This page was made by (your name)." Please add a background color so I can easily notice it. Use (as an example) "position:fixed" "top:100px", "right:40px" for positioning use "z-index" to make sure it is not covered up by other things. 

3. As is demonstrated in the video and with Example.css, re-style the page so that atleast 4 of the images on the page are fixed. 

4. Manipulate 1 of those images with "Border-Radius" to round off the corners.

5. Manipulate 1 of those images with clip-path:polygon - to create a window for the image. 

6. Manipulate 1 of those images with clip-path:circle - to create a window for the image. 

7. Manipulate 1 of those images with clip-path:ellipse - to create a window for the image.
